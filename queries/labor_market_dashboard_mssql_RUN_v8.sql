-- =============================================================================
-- LABOR MARKET SNAPSHOT DASHBOARD — SQL Server (T-SQL) — JSON-emitting "RUN" build (v8)
--
-- Same three queries as queries/labor_market_dashboard_mssql.sql (v3, tabular),
-- but each final SELECT is wrapped with FOR JSON PATH so SQL Server emits the
-- exact JSON the Highcharts front-end (apps/dashboard-front-page-original) reads.
-- Each query returns ONE NVARCHAR(MAX) cell = one .json file:
--
--   Q1 -> employment_by_locality.json
--   Q2 -> unemployment_trend.json
--   Q3 -> jobs_by_industry.json
--
-- REGION SCHEME: 14 Virginia LWDAs (AreaType '15'), NOT the legacy 5 macro
-- regions. Every county carries its lwda_code as `region`; the bar/line cross
-- filter and REGION_LABELS key off lwda_code.
--
-- SHAPE NOTES (front-end consumes arrays, not data-keyed objects):
--   * trend `counties` and jobs `regions` are ARRAYS of objects.
--   * `months` and each trend series/`data` are ARRAYS OF SCALARS — FOR JSON
--     PATH cannot emit scalar arrays, so they are built with STRING_AGG and
--     spliced in via JSON_QUERY. Arrays are aligned to a 36-row month dimension
--     with LEFT JOINs so source gaps (e.g. Oct 2025) become JSON `null` at the
--     correct index (front-end uses connectNulls:false).
--
-- KPI semantics: `kpi.*.value` = UNEMPLOYMENT rate, `delta_pts` = unemployment-
--   rate change vs prior period (the -original app renders these directly). The
--   v3 tabular query computed an EMPLOYMENT-rate delta (opposite sign); here the
--   delta is recomputed from unemployment values.
--
-- ASSUMPTION (flag): hc_key = 'us-va-' + RIGHT(Area, 3). This assumes the last
--   three chars of LABORFORCE.Area are the 3-digit VA county/independent-city
--   FIPS (works for '000001', '51001', or '001' encodings). Verify against one
--   known row (Alexandria -> us-va-510) before trusting the choropleth join.
--
-- REQUIRES: SQL Server 2017+ for STRING_AGG (Azure SQL — the production host —
--   qualifies). FOR JSON PATH needs 2016+. Read-only; no temp tables.
